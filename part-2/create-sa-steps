1. kubectl create sa [name]

2. a secret will be created along with it which has the token(password) which can be used to login to the cluster by any user

3. Use below command to get the token, just replace [SA-NAME] with service account you created
TOKEN=$(kubectl describe secrets "$(kubectl describe serviceaccount [SA-NAME] | grep -i Tokens | awk '{print $2}')" | grep token: | awk '{print $2}')

4. Now check your current context and remember its name as we will move back to it after testing
kubectl config current-context

5. Now set credentials for newly created user
kubectl config set-credentials my-user --token=$TOKEN

6. check the cluster name using below command
kubectl config view

7. now create context for new user created by running below command. Replace [CLUSTERNAME] & [USERNAME] appropriately
kubectl config set-context user-account-name --cluster=[CLUSTERNAME] --user=[USERNAME]

8. Switch to newly created context using below command. Replace [CONTEXTNAME] appropriatly
kubectl config use-context [CONTEXTNAME]

9. Switch back to old context to get full access to cluster after testing. Use [CONTEXTNAME] name you got in step 4
kubectl config use-context [CONTEXTNAME]
